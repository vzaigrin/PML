PML
===

This this the project for the “Practical Machine Learning” class from Coursera.

**PML** uses Decision Tree model called from caret package and Random Forest model called from randomForest package.

**PML2** use Decision Tree and Random Forest models both called from caret package.

Calling Random Forest from caret package takes a lot of time but gives additional capabilities for comparing models.

**PML4PDF** and **PML24PDF** have special table formatting for PDF file output.
